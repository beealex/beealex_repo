            <p>This is my personal webpage for DIGIT 400.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Bianka Alexander and I am currently a senior in the Digital Media, Arts, and Technology Program at Penn State Behrend. I am focusing on the Digital Humanites and Sound and Motion categories within the DIGIT Program, and am also working on two minors; Mass Media and Communication and Media Production.</p>
        <p> In my time outside of class, I work in the Galley/Bruno's at Penn State Behrend and am also a collegian in Theta Phi Alpha. Through these two positions I have gained a supervisor role in the Galley and have also held two chair positions, Secretary and Risk Management, in Theta Phi Alpha.</p>
